          History
        </p>

        <p class="leading-loose pl-2 text-justify">
            Founded in 1972, the troop has strived to leave a legacy within the community.
            One of the legacies is the ever growing list of scouts that have earned
            their Eagle which is scouting&apos;s highest rank.
